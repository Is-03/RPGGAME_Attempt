*New Update
There are technical issues affecting the system. The player character successfully attacked the AI character, and once the AI character's health was reduced to a low level, it died. However, the health bar did not update correctly due to an issue. In the video I provided, you can observe the AI character's health decreasing.

My first project with Unreal Engine, this RPG multiplayer game includes basic combat, health, and damage display. Learning through Unreal documentation, developer advice, and forums like Stack Overflow, I’m improving step by step. It’s a work in progress, and feedback is always appreciated!

As this is my first project with Unreal Engine, I’ve encountered challenges that have tested my skills and patience. Debugging, in particular, has been a learning experience. Currently, there’s an issue in the BPChar file where an animation montage isn’t playing as intended. Despite my best efforts, my limited experience with Unreal Engine has slowed progress.

One significant hurdle was a technical issue preventing the game from running in the editor. Unreal Engine required the project to be manually compiled from the source, which took several days to resolve due to my limited understanding of the workflow.

While these challenges have been frustrating at times, they’ve also been valuable lessons in problem-solving and perseverance. I’m determined to improve my skills and continue working on this project. Any advice or guidance is greatly appreciated as I navigate these early stages of development.
